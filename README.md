FogCutter is an augmented reality application built using the unity game engine. Written in C#, the fogCutter HUD displays realtime device data in the form of GPS location, magnetic compass, time and live camera feed. Although it is cross-platform, cross-browser, and tuned for dynamic-data visualization, it is currently only run and tested on Android.

FogCutter was built to enhance situational awareness of boat pilots, allowing the driver to have use of both hands instead of trying to hold up a device and drive at the same time, potentially limiting thier effectiveness. With this in mind fogCutter is optized for use with the with Android through the [VUZIX AR3000 Smart Glasses](https://www.vuzix.com/Products/Blade-3000-Smart-Glasses) therefore has very few buttons on the actual display. The vismute function and dimming are both handled through the glasses mounted touchpad (currently set to the escape key and a slider bar on the right side of the display).
