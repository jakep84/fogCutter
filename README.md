FogCutter is an open source augmented reality application I built using Unity3D. Written in C#, the fogCutter HUD displays realtime device data in the form of GPS location, magnetic compass, time and live camera feed. Although it is cross-platform, cross-browser, and tuned for dynamic-data visualization, it is currently only run and tested on Android.

FogCutter was built to enhance situational awareness of boat pilots, allowing the freedom of both hands instead of trying to hold up a device and drive at the same time, potentially limiting thier misson effectiveness. With this in mind fogCutter is optized for use with Android and best when paired with the [VUZIX AR3000 Smart Glasses](https://www.vuzix.com/Products/Blade-3000-Smart-Glasses). Due to the minimalist nature (less is more) there are very few buttons on the actual display. The vismute function and dimming are both handled through the glasses mounted touchpad (currently set to the escape key and a slider bar on the right side of the display). The sliding dimmer is used instead of auto dimming to allow the greater operator experience. Without a minimap in the way and having an overly iconized display the operator is better able to focus on the mission. FogCutter helps you get your bearing and stay on track with minimal effort, smarter not harder.
